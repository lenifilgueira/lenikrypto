👋 Hey there! Welcome to **LeniKrypto**, a space where I document my journey through the world of Bitcoin and crypto.  
Think of this as both my **learning journal** and a **repository of ideas, resources, and reflections** I find interesting.

## 🧠 About Me

I come from a background in economics and have spent the last five years working in financial services and IT. You might assume that gives me an edge when it comes to understanding Bitcoin and crypto... but in reality, I’m still learning every single day.

This space is a personal attempt to consolidate that learning, ask questions, and share useful insights along the way.

## ⚠️ A Quick Disclaimer

I'm not here to sell you anything or act like I’ve got it all figured out. In fact, I expect I’ll get things wrong from time to time — and that’s part of the process.

Just like the motto around Bitcoin says:  
> **"Don't trust, verify."**

So please, take everything you read here with a grain of salt, do your own research, and feel free to call me out when something doesn’t add up. I welcome all feedback, especially critical perspectives.
