ðŸŸ  What exactly is **Bitcoin**?

Depending on who you ask, itâ€™s:
- Digital gold
- A decentralized currency
- A hedge against inflation
- A scam
- A revolution

But the truth is â€” Bitcoin is all of those things, and none of them.  .

## Bitcoin: The Basics

Bitcoin is a **decentralized digital currency** that operates without a central authority. Instead of trusting banks or governments, it uses **mathematics, cryptography, and consensus** to manage transactions and issuance.

- It's **open-source**
- It's **permissionless**
- It has a **fixed supply** of 21 million coins

These properties make Bitcoin fundamentally different from fiat currencies.

## How Bitcoin Works (in a nutshell)

- **Blockchain**: A public ledger of all transactions
- **Miners**: Nodes that validate transactions and secure the network
- **Proof-of-Work**: The consensus mechanism that makes cheating the system extremely expensive
- **Private/Public Keys**: Used to send and receive Bitcoin securely

## What *The Bitcoin Standard* Taught Me (so far)

In *The Bitcoin Standard*, Ammous emphasizes Bitcoin not as a tech fad but as **a monetary evolution** â€” potentially the next chapter in the history of sound money.

He compares it to:
- **Gold**: Scarce, hard to produce, globally recognized
- **Fiat currencies**: Easily inflated, centrally controlled, vulnerable to political decisions

One key idea:  
> Sound money is not about convenience â€” it's about **preserving value across time**.

Bitcoin, with its **fixed supply** and **decentralized structure**, embodies that idea.
