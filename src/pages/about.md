Nice to meet you — I'm lenik. I have a background in economics and have spent the past five years working in financial services and IT. Despite that, I’m still learning about Bitcoin and crypto every single day. The more I dig into it, the more I realize how deep and misunderstood this space really is.

I created lenikrypto as both a **journal of my own learning** and a **repository of resources, thoughts, and insights** I come across along the way. It’s a space to document what I find interesting, what confuses me, and what I believe is worth understanding. Bitcoin, in particular, has challenged the way I think about money, value, and trust. It all started by reading *The Bitcoin Standard* — a book that, while not perfect, pushed me to re-examine many of the assumptions we make about money and how it works today.

I'm not an expert. I’m not here to shill coins, sell trading signals, or pretend I’ve got it all figured out. I expect to get things wrong — and that’s part of the process. In the spirit of Bitcoin: **“Don’t trust, verify.”** That applies to me, this blog, and anything you read in the crypto space. If you spot a mistake or have a different perspective, I’d genuinely appreciate hearing from you.

My hope is that this just website just doesn't turn out to be a blog, but a conversation. It’s me learning and exploring out loud, along with you. And if it helps even one person better understand the wild and important world of Bitcoin and crypto, that’s a win in my book.

I believe knowledge and information should be free. This site will always be open and ad-free so anyone can read and share it without barriers.
