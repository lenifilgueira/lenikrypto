		Nice to meet you, I'm lenik.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have a background in economics and have spent the past five years working in financial services and IT. Despite that, I’m still learning about Bitcoin and crypto every single day. The more I dig into it, the more I realize how deep and misunderstood this space really is.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm creating lenikrypto as both a <strong>journal of my own learning</strong> and a <strong>repository for resources, thoughts, and insights</strong> I come across along the way. It’s a space to document what I find interesting, what confuses me, and what I believe is worth understanding.
	</p>

	<p>
		Bitcoin, in particular, has challenged the way I think about money, value, and trust. It all started by reading <em>The Bitcoin Standard</em> by Saifedean Ammous a few months ago. While you can't take everything in the book as gospel, it does force you to challenge many of the frameworks for we use in our current economy and monetary systems.
	</p>

	<p>
		And to be clear: I don’t claim to be an expert. I’m not here to shill coins, sell you trading signals, or act like I’ve got it all figured out. In fact, I expect to get things wrong. That’s part of the process.
	</p>

	<p>
		In true Bitcoin spirit: <strong>"Don’t trust, verify."</strong> That applies to me, to this blog, and to every post, video, or influencer in this space. Take everything here with a grain of salt, and please — if you spot a mistake or have a different take, reach out. I welcome feedback, discussion, and correction.
	</p>

	<p>
		lenikrypto isn’t just a blog. It’s a conversation. It’s me learning out loud. And if it helps even one person better understand the wild and important world of Bitcoin and crypto, that’s a win in my book.
